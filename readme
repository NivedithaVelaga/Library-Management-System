#Advanced Library Management System

 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a **Library Management System** designed to demonstrate **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. 

Unlike simple script-based projects, this system uses a modular architecture where every entity (User, Book, Transaction) is an object interacting within a secured ecosystem. It serves as a practical case study for **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.

## OOPs Architecture & Implementation
This project is built on the four pillars of OOP. Here is how they are applied:

### 1.  Encapsulation 
* **Concept:** Binding data and methods together and hiding sensitive details.
* **Implementation:** All sensitive data (like `password`, `bookID`, and `userBalance`) is declared as `private`. Access is strictly controlled via public **Getter and Setter** methods to prevent unauthorized modification.
    * *Example:* A student cannot directly change their fine amount; it can only be updated via the `calculateFine()` method.

### 2.  Inheritance 
* **Concept:** Creating new classes from existing ones to reduce code redundancy.
* **Implementation:** We use a base class `User` that holds common attributes (Name, ID, Email).
    * `Admin` **extends** `User` (Inherits login logic, adds "Add Book" features).
    * `Student` **extends** `User` (Inherits login logic, adds "Borrow Book" features).

### 3. Polymorphism 
* **Concept:** The ability of a method to do different things based on the object acting upon it.
* **Implementation:**
    * **Method Overriding:** The `login()` function behaves differently for an Admin (redirects to Dashboard) vs. a Student (redirects to Search).
    * **Method Overloading:** The `searchBook()` function allows users to search by **Title**, **Author**, or **ID** using the same function name but different parameters.

### 4.  Abstraction 
* **Concept:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
* **Implementation:** High-level operations like "Issue Book" are exposed to the user, while the complex logic (checking database connectivity, validating availability, calculating dates) is hidden behind abstract interfaces or internal private methods.

## 📐 UML Class Diagram
The following diagram illustrates the relationships and hierarchy between the classes.

    %% Abstraction & Inheritance
    class User {
        <<Abstract>>
        -String name
        -String id
        +login()
        +logout()
    }
    
    class Admin {
        +addBook()
        +removeBook()
        +viewReports()
    }
    
    class Student {
        -double fineAmount
        +borrowBook()
        +returnBook()
        +payFine()
    }

    %% Encapsulation
    class Book {
        -String isbn
        -String title
        -boolean isAvailable
        +getDetails()
        +setAvailability()
    }

    User <|-- Admin : Inherits
    User <|-- Student : Inherits
    Admin "1" --> "*" Book : Manages
    Student "1" --> "*" Book : Borrows
