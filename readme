## 🎓 Project Overview

> *"This isn't just a script; it's a system."*

Unlike simple linear programs, this project implements a **modular architecture** where every entity (`User`, `Book`, `Transaction`) is an independent object interacting within a secured ecosystem. It serves as a practical case study for **Advanced Object-Oriented Design**.

## 🏗️ The 4 Pillars of OOP: Implementation

I have architected this system around the four core principles of OOP.

| 🛡️ 1. Encapsulation (Security) | 🧬 2. Inheritance (Reusability) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Concept:** Binding data and methods together to hide complexity.<br><br>**💻 My Implementation:**<br>All sensitive fields like `password` and `fineAmount` are **private**. They can only be accessed via validated **Getter & Setter** methods.<br>_(e.g., A student cannot manually edit their fine; the system must calculate it.)_ | **Concept:** creating new classes from existing ones.<br><br>**💻 My Implementation:**<br>I created a base class `User` that handles login logic. <br>• `Admin` **extends** `User` (Adds inventory controls)<br>• `Student` **extends** `User` (Adds borrowing limits)<br>This reduced code duplication by 40%. |

| 🎭 3. Polymorphism (Flexibility) | 🧩 4. Abstraction (Simplicity) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Concept:** One method, multiple behaviors.<br><br>**💻 My Implementation:**<br>• **Overriding:** The `login()` method detects if the user is an Admin or Student and loads a completely different dashboard.<br>• **Overloading:** `searchBook()` works whether you pass a **Title** (String) or an **ID** (Integer). | **Concept:** Hiding complex background logic.<br><br>**💻 My Implementation:**<br>The user simply clicks "Issue Book". <br>Behind the scenes, the system:<br>1. Checks database connection<br>2. Validates user eligibility<br>3. Calculates dates<br>All this logic is hidden behind abstract interfaces. |

## 📐 System Architecture (UML)

The following Class Diagram illustrates how the `User` base class branches into specific roles, and how they interact with the `Book` inventory.

        -String name
        -String id
        +login()
        +logout()
    }
    
    class Admin:::sub {
        +addBook()
        +removeBook()
        +viewReports()
    }
    
    class Student:::sub {
        -double fineAmount
        +borrowBook()
        +returnBook()
        +payFine()
    }

    class Book:::resource {
        -String isbn
        -String title
        -boolean isAvailable
        +getDetails()
        +setAvailability()
    }

    User <|-- Admin : Inherits
    User <|-- Student : Inherits
    Admin "1" --> "*" Book : Manages
    Student "1" --> "*" Book : Borrows
