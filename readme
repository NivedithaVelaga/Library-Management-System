# Library Management System

## Project Description

This **Library Management System** is a **college-level project developed using Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts**.  
The project models how a library manages students, instructors, courses, subjects, schedules, and transactions in a structured and organized way.

The main focus of this project is **database design and system modeling**, showing how real-world entities are connected using proper relationships.

---

## What the Project Does

The system represents the following core functionalities:

- Maintains **student details**
- Maintains **instructor details**
- Manages **courses and subjects**
- Handles **class schedules**
- Tracks **transactions related to students**
- Shows how all entities are connected using **primary keys and foreign keys**

The project is designed to clearly demonstrate **entity relationships** rather than UI complexity.

---

## Key Entities Used

- Student  
- Instructor  
- Courses  
- Subjects  
- Schedules  
- Transaction  

Each entity is connected using well-defined **primary key (PK)** and **foreign key (FK)** relationships.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Concept: **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**
- Database Design: **ER Modeling**
- Language Used: **Java** (as per implementation)
- Tools: **DBMS concepts, UML / ER diagram design tools**

---

## Academic Purpose

This project was developed as part of **college coursework** to demonstrate:
- Strong understanding of **OOPS concepts**
- Proper **database design**
- Real-world system modeling using ER diagrams
