## 📋 Executive Summary
This project is a high-performance, console-based **Library Management System** engineered to demonstrate the practical application of **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigms. 

Unlike basic CRUD applications, this system implements a secure, role-based architecture where `Admin` and `Student` users interact within a controlled ecosystem. It features persistent data storage, automated fine calculation logic, and strict input validation to prevent system crashes.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Design
The core strength of this project lies in its modular design. The system is decoupled into three layers: **Presentation (UI)**, **Business Logic**, and **Data Persistence**.
